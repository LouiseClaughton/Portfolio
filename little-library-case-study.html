                    <h1>The Little Library Foundation</h1>
                    <p>I created a one page website for a self-driven brief for a charity which provides donated books to children in hospital. The brief I gave myself was to create a one page website
                    with a theme of stories and fairytales, with a simple colour scheme reminiscent of candlelight, with the following sections: Header/CTA, About, Our Misson & CTA, and Contact.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="library-wireframes">
            <!--Row 1-->
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <p>I knew that the font choice would make or break this website, so I spent some time experimenting with a font combination. I wanted the heading font to be reminiscient of fairytale
                        books, without being overly decorative, so I opted for Averia Serif Libre, a textured serif font. For the body, I wanted a simple sans-serif font which complemented the header 
                        font without stealing the spotlight. I went with Jost, a simple, down to earth sans-serif font.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-6">

            </div>
            <!--Row 2-->
            <div class="row">
                <p>I began the design of the website in Figma, creating several wireframes. I knew I wanted clear, seperated sections, so I just had to decide on the order. I decided to split up the 
                    areas of heavy text with an inspirational quote, to stop the middle section of the website from feeling like a wall of text. I also made the 'Our Story' and 'Our Mission' segments
                    have opposing image directions, to create interest on the page. I did the same with the text alignment; no two adjacent sections have the same text alignment, which creates
                    visual interest. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <!--Row 3-->
            <div class="row">
                <img src="images/TLLF/TLLF Wireframes.png" class="image">
            </div>           
        </section>

        <section id="library-goal">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-6">
                    <p>The goal of this website was to get viewers to donate unwanted books. I included multiple call to actions, and a form at the end of the page for viewers to enter their details for
                        book collection. But I also wanted the viewers to be able to navigate to whichever section they wanted without having to scroll through everything, so I included a sticky navbar with
                        relative links to each major section. With this approach visitors to the website could easily get information they wanted right away.
                    </p>
                    <p>The final step was to add the final text and images to the website. I wanted the website to feel open and familial, so I included images of parents reading to children, and groups
                        of people hanging out together. For the quote section, I added candles to the background, to give the feeling of hope, as a candle is often symbolically used as imagery to suggest
                        a spark of light amongst dark times. For the text, I opted for a story which was designed to pull on viewer's heartstrings, and text which called to viewer's empathy. The form and buttons
                        use rounded shapes, making the act of donating seem more approachable. Finally, I kept the animations and transitions on the webpage to a minimum, as I didn't want to distract from the content.
